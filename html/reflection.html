<!-- The first issues I ran into were how to even import a CSS template from Bootstrap. 
I watched a ton of YouTube tutorials and read a lot of articles. W3Schools and GetBootStrap/Docs were really helpful. -->

<!-- 1. Just learning how to read the tutorials on the Bootstrap docs was a big hurdle. I initially had trouble with deciphering the steps (what, and why, was changed from each example to the next) a solution was trying to present. 2. I ran into issues when trying to import images because I was making the explorer file path as the src, not just the subfolder.
    3. I continually ran into formatting issues for getting the text to stay to the bottom and display my name & github link. After re-watching the class tutorials numerous times, I think I finally fixed it.
